# Privacy Policy

**Offline TranslateKit AI Translator** is committed to user privacy. Our philosophy is simple: your data belongs to you, and we have no interest in it.

## 1. No Data Collection
This extension **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data, browsing history, or text content. We do not use any analytics, tracking, or telemetry services.

## 2. On-Device Processing
All translation and language detection are performed **locally on your device** using the browser's built-in AI APIs (Gemini Nano). 
- No text you translate is ever sent to our servers or any third-party cloud service.
- The extension works entirely offline once the browser has downloaded the necessary language models.

## 3. Local Storage
The extension uses `chrome.storage.local` solely to store your personal preferences, such as:
- Your "Ignored Languages" list.
- Your custom keyboard shortcuts.
- Your preferred source and target languages.

This data remains on your machine and is never synced or shared.

## 4. Changes to This Policy
Because we do not collect any user data (including email addresses), we cannot notify users of changes. Any updates to this policy will be posted here.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/e-kotov/OfflineTranslateKitAITranslator/issues).
